Set up the Ultrasonic Sensor to detect the distance from itself to the bottom of the container. Register this distance as EMPTY. Check distance for 100% full and register that number FULL. 

get_level(); in real time, gets the distance from the sensor to the surface (bottom of container or waste) and returns the current_level. Probably have a way in this function to check if the container is opened without being unlocked using is_unlocked.

is_full(threshold); compares current_level to the provided threshold which returns true if current_level goes over threshold. 

update_visuals(current_level); gets current_level and displays it on a GUI and on the LED screen in real-time. Can simply use the LED Screen as a bar, like a battery level on a phone. 

code_check(); that returns is_unlocked if provided sequence is correctly given within a 4 second span. Compares to a provided CODE.

start_alarm(); that buzzes the alarm for as long as it is receiving true.
